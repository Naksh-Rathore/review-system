# Review System

## Overview
This is my review system. It is a full-stack application made in the **MERN Stack**. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node.js. It is an extremely popular tech stack mainly used for startups.
My web application is similiar to **Google Reviews**, which is also a reviewing site for businesses. Reviews can affect businesses a lot, since many consumers first check reviews before buying from them. 
That's why this project has many real-world applications.
